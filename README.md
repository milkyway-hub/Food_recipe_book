Cuisine is celebrated worldwide for its diversity and flavors, yet accessing recipes in an interactive and user-friendly format remains a challenge. The Food Recipe Book aims to address this gap by providing a dynamic web application where users can explore Indian recipes effortlessly. The project emphasizes the use of web development techniques, incorporating modular components such as recipe cards, search functionality, and modal pop-ups for detailed views. This application not only enhances user engagement but also serves as a template for building similar culinary websites.
